# Efficient Guided Evolution for Neural Architecture Search


## Usage 

Create a conda environment using the env.yml file

```bash
conda env create -f env.yml
```

Activate the environment and follow the instructions to install
```
conda activate gea
```

Install nasbench (see https://github.com/google-research/nasbench)

Download the NDS data from https://github.com/facebookresearch/nds and place the json files in path_to_code/nds_data/
Download the NASbench101 data (see https://github.com/google-research/nasbench)
Download the NASbench201 data (see https://github.com/D-X-Y/NAS-Bench-201)

Reproduce all of the results by running 

```bash
./run.sh
```
